# **Part 1:**

*Step 2:*

Could not connect when trying to run python code

*Step 3:*

The code was modified to take 3 inputs from the command line. These inputs are the number of points along the string, the cycles and also the sample. 

The check_args() function checks the inputs and gives an error if they are incorrect. The time steps and step size are then calculated. Memory is then allocated. An output file is opened and the loop runs, updating the position each time with the positions being written to the csv file
